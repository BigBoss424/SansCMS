# SansCMS
SansCMS is not a CMS, hence the name. SansCMS is merely a PHP + CSS framework to kick-start the development of a simple website. The primary aim of the project is to make it easier to have a simple portfolio website up and running without the hassle of having to code it from the ground up.

As a designer myself I think it's very valuable for a designer to know a thing or two about coding. SansCMS is an ongoing experiment that's been my excuse to better understand PHP and the server-side part of it.

Please feel free to contribute to the project, and to use the framework for your own project however you want.
